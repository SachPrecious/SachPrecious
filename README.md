# 💻 Hi, I'm Sachithra

I am a trainee DevOps Engineer with a passion for 🤖 automation and 🌥️ cloud technologies. I'm always on the lookout for new and innovative ways to optimize and streamline processes, and I believe that technology has the power to make a positive impact on the world.

In my free time, I enjoy 💻 learning new programming languages, 🧪 experimenting with different technologies, and 🤝 contributing to open-source projects.

## Skills
- 🔧 Automation
- 💻 Cloud Technologies (AWS, Azure)
- 🔄 Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins
- 💻 Virtualization (VMWare, Docker)
- 📈 Configuration Management Tools
- 🌎 Terraform

## Projects

Here are a few of the projects I've been working on:

- **Project 1**: A 🌥️ cloud-based application that automates a certain process, reducing manual intervention and increasing efficiency, using Jenkins for CI/CD.
- **Project 2**: An 💻 infrastructure automation project, using Ansible and Terraform, that sets up and configures a multi-tier web application environment on AWS.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you're interested in collaborating on a project! 🤝
